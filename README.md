# Ali-MQ
Non-official Node.JS client for Aliyun Message Queue, based on official C++ SDK.

Use node-cmake to build, so make sure that there's cmake with a minimum version of 3.1 installed in your environment.

The official C++ SDK requires g++ 4.9, g++ higher than 4.9 will cause strange segmentation faults.
